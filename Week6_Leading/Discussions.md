## How can leaders acquire and lose power within their organization

The question reminds me of a recently former skip manager named Steve. He joined my team, and was assigned 3 directly reporting managers and span of control over 50 engineers.

His manager hired him to drive the unification of internal processes across our division. As he started this position he was 1 of 5 senior leaders and had a significant amount of political power. However as he failed to implement meaningful change at a fast enough cadence, his power began to drop. At the 14th month of his command, they demoted him to being an individual contributor and reassigned his teams.

There were challenges to making the deadlines. For example, merging internal processes of two distinctly different entities requires a reasonable understanding of the political structure, goals, time lines, and culture. These need to be aligned despite external pressures for employees to focus on fixing external processes. (e.g. What we see vs What the customer sees)

## Describe political behavior you have observed

People who do not participate in the political behavior can still be successful, though they are playing the same game at a much higher risk. Consider the introvert that hides in their office and relies on their manager to sell them during stack reviews.

Even if the manager is a great salesman, they hold too much power over the career growth. Assuming the manager is perfectly ethical, there is still a risk of that leader switching jobs. This removes any dependent political power for our introvert through that channel.

The only way to mitigate that risk is again by networking with a larger number of stake holders. Eliminating that single point of failure, while also gaining more visibility within the larger team.

The natural byproduct of networking across a larger portion of the business, is larger business impact. Therefore political behavior is self servant and everyone should participate in it.

### Should managers constrain communication for political advantage

> In one of my first individual meetings with my new manager a few weeks ago, he said he wants everything that is talked about in our one on one meetings to be kept between us. Then he told me that he tells every employee something different and waits to see what gets around so he know who he can trust and who is spreading rumors. I do not consider information to be a rumor when it is coming straight from the manager. So I wholeheartedly disagreed with this strategy but did not know what to do. Should I warn my fellow teammates about what he said or by doing so would I then be the one falling into that trap?

Step one to establishing trust with new recurites; tell them you don't trust them until they have earned it. That is a horrible thing to say and you should let them know that its moronic.

Let's assume that you work in a highly political organization, that is full of sneaky people and thus require secrecy. What this manager is effectively stated is:

1. Information from me is not always reliable

2. Sometimes the reliability is intentionally misguiding or malicious

3. I will not always be honest in this relationship, hopefully your more ethical

What I would do is smile nod politely, and sit back and wait. Observe the first few hands of their political poker and see who is who. After you understand the internal rules of the game then decide which members of the team you could even trust with similar information.

As for this specific information no reason to spread it, the others on your team have already played this dance and know the score. =)

## If you can only change cost, process, or culture; which would you choose

I would choose to lead changing the culture as that is what drives the most business impact, and shapes more of the company. For example, the sales team is inefficient in finding leads and selling the product; the leadership wants something done about this.

- Project of Cost; this could be centralizing the different branches and removing redundancies. 
- Process; this could be making the sales life cycle more stream lined. 
- Culture; define a data driven culture where sales uses metrics to focus on improvement areas.

All three are good initiatives, however only the third is teaching the staff how to fish. It is giving them the tools to identify changes to process or where additional costs can be saved. This is impactful work, it is changing the way people think how business is being done. 

## How do you overcome complancy

One of the common resistance to change is complacency, which happens when the staff feels safe and do not need to work any harder. For example consider if you landed a job that paid 250,000 + benefits doing something interesting with a friendly team.

In this situation you have all the elements of the hierarchy of needs, what reason is there to switch jobs or work extra hard? Sure you could give up your Saturdays to work more and maybe they'd give you 275k as a thank you. But why? The increase is not life changing and for many the time is more valuable.

For these scenarios it is effectively a motivation problem, similar to what we discussed two weeks prior. The change needs to be addressed as what is being gained, and why should the person care. Consider attaching intrinsic rewards such as more visibility and acknowledgment.
