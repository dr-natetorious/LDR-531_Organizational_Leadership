## Describe your ideal organization and structure

My ideal organization is fast paced and resolving the latest major crisis 3 out of 4 weeks. These are the points where everyone comes together and everyone puts in their A game. The interpersonal culture, I'm less concerned about provided everyone is respectful and not rude. 

For structure, it would depend on my position. As an individual contributor, I would prefer standard big business corporate America. You have resources and general safety of not being laid off. Though as an owner, I would prefer a modular business that emphasizes outsourcing everything possible.

Only the core competencies; such quality control, brand direction, and strategic oversight need to be left in house. This enables the business to keep long term costs non existent. As a result the costs are well controlled resulting in better profit versus revenue control. 

## Which type of organizational structure would your leadership style be most/least effective

I've worked at a startup, mid sized business and fortune 100. Each of these had different pros and cons toward what the leader was permitted to do. These limitations strongly centered around communication and availability of resources.

At the startup, the company had 2 owners and 4 employees. We had the ability to be extremely agile, however any knowledge lacking or additional resources were unlikely to be delivered. This ironically inhibited our ability to deliver agility. Communication was trivial, everyone was within shouting distance.

At the mid sized business, the company had 30-50 people. They had revenue <10m and it really felt like a "family business" in that everyone knew everyone and it was very easy to communicate and get things accomplished.

At the fortune 100, my product team has 691 people according out Outlook right now. Communication requires a significant effort, however it is trivial to get funding for any business justifiable purpose. This makes it easy to get things accomplished, provided you can notify the leadership and get buy off on the plan. 

## How do organizational culture and structure co-exist

This afternoon I interviewed a partner level architect on his views of culture and organization. Here are some paraphrased notes.

Culture is the results of practices, processes and rewards; how the organization implements these systems expands or limits their potential. One of the challenges is that businesses typically reward the wrong thing, such as under promising and over delivering instead risk taking. This causes the organization to fall behind instead of playing to their strengths. In any culture diversity is also extremely important, his organization is predominately 38 year old software engineering men. This has caused them to miss some new technological revolutions as they were unwilling to deviate from "tried and proven methodologies."

Organizational structure needs to meet the needs of the business, unless those needs sacrifice exceptional leaders. For example, within his division there are four large products collectively generating 3 billion in revenue. They could be more efficient by overlapping more of these products, however it would mean removing the need for 3 or 4 great leaders. The benefit of those people outweighs the potential savings of the optimization.

There is also value in having relationships between the teams, instead of them being the same larger team. As the size of the team grows the complexity of communication grows exponentially. Ideally the group should be small enough where everyone knows everyone else. 

When it comes to remote teams, the most successful groups have well defined charters and an entire feature that they own. If the ownership is shared there is high latency and the remote team feels out of the loop. In addition extra care needs to be taken to avoid "individual communication instead of group communication." These are a sign that established communication processes do not exist.

## How does loss aversion influence employee behavior

Most people do not like change, change represents unknown risks which brings about uncertainty and fear. From a behavioral economics perspective there is also challenges due to loss aversion. Loss aversion is the believe that the loss of something we currently have is worth more than something we could gain.

For example, when Alice considers switching jobs the new company might offer her an extra 10k/year but doesn't offer equal health benefits to her current company. Despite the benefits only being worth 5k/year she is more likely to focus on this 5k loss than the 10k increase. 

While it seems irrational there are countless studies which consistently prove that people fear change and are loss averse. Consider all of the people in bad relationships with bad partners, its no different than the terrible job they won't leave.

To mitigate these challenges leaders need to have stress management solutions and mechanisms for coaxing the turtles out of their shells. Change is not the end of something good, its the start of something new.

That's a good follow up comment, the new staff member will not only have stress from the new job; they will also have stress to their personal life. Imagine if Alice had to move from California to North Dakota.

Her children would be upset with the loss of their lifestyle, the weather is no longer sunny, everything is in boxes, nothing is familiar, etc. For many people this can be as difficult if not more to cope with.

Now that Alice has lost some or all of the support of "her home team," it can result in feeling very isolated. She will likely start to wonder why did I even do this?

All of this stress from her personal life is likely to spill into her professional life. This high stress and high pressure experience will make it difficult for her to bring her A game to work. This will increase the learning curve and increase the time that she is unable to provide the full value to the organization.

## How can you bridge between different generations in the labor market

The best way to bridge four generations is with Pink Flyodd. Seriously name one other band that is as equally accepted across the generation boundaries?

Unfortunately we cannot list to the Wall and Darkside of the Moon all day, and need to find other ways of transcending knowledge and acceptance through the ages. For example, younger people need to be willing to learn new skills and trades; meanwhile the older people have those skills and trades. Having them work together in a mentoring relationship can help form a connection between them.

Another strategy is to clearly state what the expectations are and how performance will be measured. These requirements cannot be based on age as that would be discrimination (and illegal). When employees know what is needed and how you will grade them, they tend to align with those asks. The ones that cannot will eventually be managed out and then the problem is resolved on its own.

## Why is it important to analyze an implementation strategy

I think that a lot of untrained or under trained business owners have difficulties applying these concepts. This leads to lots of challenges such as incomplete business plans or over margined loans.

Some times these half baked plans are able to workout, but more commonly the owner will lose a bunch of time and money. Worse their dreams of making it big in the business world will have collapsed. Then worst of all they will need to lay off all their employees, which can be a hard action in itself.

Creating a reasonable strategy is not a complex task, provided the analysts are honest and fair in the assessment. Evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT); then answer how likely is success? If the odds are low, then the high level plan can still work but the weaknesses and threats need to be compensated with backup plans, exit strategies, and insurance.
