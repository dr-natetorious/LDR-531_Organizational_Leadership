## Initiative in the Workplace

> In a team, there are some who prefer to take the initiative and others who prefer to be told what to do, what are the benefits and drawbacks of each preference?

Depending on the situation being the "leader" or "grunt" will be significantly more work than the other role. Consider for example a team tasked with building a tank.

This requires a lot of relatively straight forward mechanical work, that stilled workers can accomplish with out encoring large amounts of stress. In contrast the lead architect of the project needs to worry about every detail, ensure senior leadership is happy, and deeply think about every issue.

Contrast that with being a manager of software project that is in maintenance mode (no more large changes planned). They only need to worry about the day to day business and when there is an issue they delegate it to the individual contributors.  In this scenario the leader receives the benefits of being on auto pilot.

## Personalitity Styles in the Workplace

> Based on the DiSC assessment, what is a personality style that you might have more difficulty working with? Why? What are some strategies you might implement to work more effectively with this particular personality?

In general I am an out going person at work that likes attention and credit for taking on hard challenges. Typically I work well with most people, though one person specifically stands out.

A year ago I had to work with another person that was much like myself. He would rewrite my reports, talk over me, and try to control the situation. This became very frustrating as it didn't really matter what I did, it wasn't going to be used. After roughly 6 months or so he switched to another team and all of my problems left with him.

Looking back at the situation a better approach would have been to establish clear areas of ownership. By working out agreeable terms it would have improved the work environment and also reduced duplicate effort.

### Can similar personality styles always work well together

I would generalize your comment to: Typically similar personality styles will align unless the styles have a large amount of ego.

For example if the person's personality style is they want to talk over everyone and control the situation, they can conflict with another person who wants the same thing.

This occurs not only in personalities but in other closed economic models, where the amount of resources are limited. As resources, in this example 'attention' become more scarce the flexibility to work together will diminish.

## Money != Motivated Employees

Typically when someone thinks about motivating there employees the first thought is throw more money at the situation. However for most business professional positions already come with a reasonable amount of money.

Don't get me wrong I'm not going to turn down an extra 5,000$/year but that's not going to change our life style. That 5k is first taxed at 28% making it really 3600, which is then distributed across 24 pay periods making it 150$ per check.

Even if it did change your life its reoccurring which by definition makes it not special. To compound the problem that money will be direct deposited into an account that is used to auto pay your credit card. You never touch it or acknowledge its existence outside of a periodically connecting to your bank site.

Instead leadership needs to hand out "small" prizes which have little to no actual monetary value. For example I did some volunteer work for a partner team and they rewarded me with a 6 pack of beer. That cost less than 10$ and made me want to help them on other efforts. Concert/Sporting/gift cards/ event tickets are another great examples

Motivation is contextually sensitive, even with the same person.

For example if could sympathize with the situation of having bunch of children and lived pay check to pay check. In that context having an extra 150 does change your lifestyle and is highly valued. Later in that same person's career they will typically make 80-120k at which point it no longer has that same influence. 

Dan Arily of duke university did a study on how people proceve money. All of this results showed that it exponentially reaches a platue, such that we are extremely happy about small rewards (e.g. 3$ off) and care less on big ticket items such as buying a 30k car and adding 500$ for leather seats. Intutively it should be the reverse.

## Advantages and Drawbacks of Employee Empowerment

When employees are empowered to make their own decisions; it improves job satisfaction and frees up the manager to focus on more direction setting tasks. However it does come with a risk that the employee might not have the capacity to make the right decision on how to perform the task.

To maximize the likelihood of success proper hand off of the assignment needs to take place. First explain 'why' the work is important, then ask them to come up with a 1 page report outlining their approach. Iterate on the plan once or twice, potentially including other peers for more diverse feedback. Then have the person begin the work. Periodic updates on progress are important so there is visibility into the work.

Typically our team uses that general workflow for all new projects. After everyone agrees on the vision and direction, someone on my team will own that work all up. If there is large change requests they will bring them to the weekly triage meeting, otherwise they are free to prioritize fixes and figure out what "do the right thing" means.

## How might you use this information to improve your management or leadership skills through professional development

In order to be effective leaders we need to first understand ourselves. One common starting point is to evaluate our personality through standardized tests and peer reviews. Based on this feedback it can help us uncover hidden characteristics that we were unaware of.  Once those traits have been surfaced we can make a conscience effort to prevent ourselves from doing these things.

For example I used to have a horrible trait of calling stupid things stupid, however that is rude and doesn't help progress the dialog. Now that I am aware of it, in situations of "moronic discussion" I work harder at directing the conversation instead of killing it. I look for the good idea that is hidden in the middle of the madness and figure out how we can extract that. If that is not possible there's always Angry Birds until the meeting ends.

## What are successful traits of mentors

Mentors have a lot of influence, especially over new employees. They are responsible for teaching the organizational culture and also how to get the tasks at hand complete. In the past, I've had both good and bad mentors.

When I think of the excellent mentors, I think of supervisors that wanted to teach different views and get me outside of my comfort zone. They would encourage new tasks and suggest high visibility projects that would improve the work environment.

When I think of the bad mentors, they were typically unhappy with their job. They cheated the system and played the odds that no one would fire them. They knew how to get out of work while still covering their behind. Cheating can work for a short time but it is not the way to build a career.
