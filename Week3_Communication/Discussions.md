## Storming is critical for success

During this weeks mentoring session, I asked our senior director his views toward this topic. To paraphrase some of my notes here...

The easiest way to slow down group development is to skip the storming phase. He said nothing scares him more than a new v-team where the people haven't worked together and there is no conflict. This means either the group is to myopic or the group is going to implode in a few months.

For example when building a software application there will typically be two different approaches on the table. If the conflict is not resolved, the leadership arbitrarily selects one. The loose side will not want to be seen as a problem, and will go along with it. During this period they are passive aggressive and hoping that the project is a failure so they can prove they were right.

He also described that managers do not manage conflict, instead they need to liberate it. When they do liberate it they need to make sure they go deep enough and fully get the problems addressed. If they do not then there is again the risk that half of the team is hoping the other half fails.

## How do roles impact team communication

During an undergraduate sociology course we dug into the Stanford Prison experiment. The basic idea was to randomly assigning volunteers into two groups prisoners and guards. Then through a series of intense role bonding tasks the two volunteer groups quickly adopted their mock roles as reality.

As future leaders this is very fascinating as the experiment demonstrates the how people naturally become the role that is expected of them. For example if we want hard working competitive employees; then we need to define a role which requires hard working competitive employees, and put people in those positions.

Contracted, if we fail to create such an environment or default to laizze-fair models then we run the risk of not having competitive employees. They know that working 40 hours or 50 hours will reward the same, and feel no need to put in the extra effort.

If you haven't had a chance to watch the documentary on the work you can find it on youtube.

It is a 30 minute video which is worth the time. https://youtu.be/Cbax9v9N_bU

## Expectations versus Measurement

In the book Elephants Can Dance, the ex-CEO of IBM makes an argument that expectations are not the important part of the discussion. Instead Gerstner makes the case that how you define the measurement is more critical.

For example at my day job we asked 500 engineers to add logging in responsible manner that does not use too much disk space. Everyone agreed with the ask and went off to do the work. However since we were not measuring it this responsible behavior ended up being in the petabytes (millions of GB) per year.

If we had instead defined the expectation in terms of specific units, then the teams would have had an expectation (log responsible) and an ability to determine how responsible (GB per year) they actually were.

The challenges become even more complex if a measurement is never even defined. For instance telling the staff to devote 20% of their time to improving the corporate culture. What does that even mean? If we spent 1:5 days at the pub everyone would have higher moral thus improved culture. However were is the actual value gained for the business.

## How does unethical behavior influence team dynamics

As previously externally cited http://danariely.com/, a behavioral economist, did research this subject.

For an experiment he would fill a room with student volunteers, and pay them 2$ per math problem that they correctly solved within the time period. At the end he asked them to "shred" their test and come to the front and honestly report their score. The shredder would remove the edges but leave the actual paper in tact.

He ran the test across several universities and would vary having an actor in the room, both wearing the schools jersey and wearing the neighboring rival schools jersey. The actor would openly evangelize cheating on the test since they had no way of knowing.

What they found was that the actor wearing the school jersey increased cheating by XX% percent, while having the actor in the room wearing the rivals school jersey decreased cheated by XX%. This was theorized because the students identified with the role or wanted to be better than the alternative role.

Behavior economics is a topic that effective leaders need to know exists and have some insights into it. For example, if we do not understand group and role mentality, how will we understand our peers and directs?

The concepts expand to other areas of the business situation such as how to communicate with colleges. For instance, parolees before lunch are 15% less likely to be released than similar cases after lunch. These unconscious bias are part of human nature and can take years to uncover without access to quality research.

Another core concept that comes up is the control of money. Researchers have found that people are more willing to stay with their current deal than gamble on a better position, if there is a risk of not getting equal to their present. Another observation is that money is valued logarithmically, where each increasing dollar less valued than previous. Having these insights can help us better negotiate our staffs compensation so they feel better and we pay less.

## How does communication continuity influence business continuity

I was reading this article http://it.slashdot.org/story/15/11/23/1739227/what-the-sony-hack-looked-like-to-employees; at it sounded relevant to this course. It describes how the employees of Sony perceived the massive hack that took down their company.

It was particularly interesting to hear how communication completely fell apart within the company. They were completely reliant on only digital communication and had no backup system for continuing to spread information. Due to a lack of dissemination the company became dysfunctional and some employees had no work and others had double work.

As future leaders we need to make sure that we have the ability to continue communication even during a crisis. Our crisis might not be angry hackers it could be simply an act of god. Consider for example an earth quake or some other force of nature.

## How do you ensure efficient communication within the organization

For another class we covered this topic by studying infamous Claud Shannon's paper "Mathematics of Communication" http://www.essrl.wustl.edu/~jao/itrg/shannon.pdf 

His paper defined the mathematical models for describing how communication works between two sources. It was later used as the bases for the information theory, which is now an entire field of science. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication 

Within the context of this course it is relevant as it helps us understand the signal to noise challenges. Once we are aware it becomes more clear that without a certain minimal amount of transmitted data the receiver will never understand what was sent. It would be as though we never even attempted sending the message in the first place.

For example if we told the wife only "i need help to be there at noon" but did not define what "there" or "which noon." How would she know what we need? How could she plan to accomidate the request? In a sense we have sent words and asked for a tangible action, which cannot be performed. The end result will be equal to never asking for the assistance in the first place.

## Are there benefits to conflict

Conflict comes from diversity, and as we covered in the human resource course having a diverse work group is critical to success. If we do not have sufficient diversity than the group will not consider a sufficiently wide variety of solutions and the most efficient one might not be considered.

The conflict comes in two forms, positive and negative. Positive conflict is discussion which benefits the discussion and progresses the ideas forward. Negative conflict is confrontational for the sole sake of being confrontational. It does not provide any additional benefit and slows down progress.

For example if someone posted on to the discussion board their answer to this question, and another person might completely disagree with it. They would then post a follow up stating why they don't agree and what might be a better solution. This is constructive and is covering more of the scenario.

Negative conflict would be replying to that discussion answer and simply saying "your dumb that's a terrible idea." The replier has not explained why the idea is bad or incorrect. This has effectively wasted everyone's time and no new information has been provided.

## How do you deal with conflict

Conflict is a natural part of the life and something that we need to embrace. Without conflict groups would accept poor ideas and not be as successful.

Part of embracing that conflict means that we need to be willing to have our viewpoints challenged. When this occurs we need to not take it personal, they are not attacking us. It is important to listen to the different opinion and seek to find the merits that are being presented. Try to strike a compromise where everyone wins.

If you cannot compromise then it best to put the discussion on hold. Sometimes pausing and regrouping with a new strategy or more information is required to make progress. For other scenarios the opposite is required and we need to demand a deadline. When a dead line is introduced it can cause the other party to give up concessions.
