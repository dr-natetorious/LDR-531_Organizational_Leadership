## Indicators of good leaders

Some times to understand what makes something good, we need to look at what makes something bad. From my experience I've had a few bad leaders that I'll summarize here.

First was "Mr. Bradly" the supervisor at a high school position. He didn't care to motivate people, once openly quoting "there is no reason to ever give anyone a raise, we can train and replace all of you within a month." While it was an accurate statement he didn't need to be so blunt. 

Then there was "Curt" and "Jeff" mid level managers at different companies. While they both worked hard and wanted to do the right thing, it was clear that upper management did not respect them. This made them ineffective and working under them felt like dead end career moves.

Then there was "Jeremy" who was nice to your two faced in his actions. Worse he would steal from our tills then take the difference from our check. Having a corrupt and unethical boss makes the employees feel the system is fixed and not worth the effort.

When I worked at a mid sized consulting business which had only a few dozen employees. One of the people that I worked with often was named Ryan. He was very calm, patient, and very technically competent. 

He had a way of getting things done which was almost smooth. When he needed help on a project he would state the problem and provide some general details of the customer who was paying for the solution. If you didn't have time to solve it that was fine he could take a crack at it. Even if you didn't have time the guy was so nice, not push over nice, that you wanted to rearrange your schedule or stay late to help out. 

After six months I had my first review with the CTO, who asked what I thought of my management chain. I told the CTO that he was an alright guy no complaints, to which he replied I'm not your boss Ryan is.

That's the way to lead as peers in the thick of it together, no us versus them.

## What are successful traits of leadership

A leader is like a skirt, needing to be long enough to cover everything but short enough to keep things interesting. By which I mean that they need to be involved enough that the project is successful but not get in the way.

For example if a team member is overwhelmed due to too many tasks, recent personal issue, or lacking experience; the leader needs to step in and transition a portion of that work to another member. In contrast a member who is fully capable of driving their portion needs less involvement and the leader needs to merely check up periodically.

If the leader has the needed traits to be more of an oversight official then they are more likely to be successful. The employees feel less micromanaged at one end of the spectrum while the other feels they are getting the needed support.

### If a leader has an employee that cannot keep up with tasks, [...] make the choice if the employee is worth replacement or not.

I do not disagree with that point and it would be part of the manager being available at just the right amount. For employees that either lack maturity or have regressed due to a personal issue, the leader needs to be more involved and keep a closer eye on the situation. Contrasted, if the employee is a high performer, then the situation can often be better handled by not handling at all.

### You also speak as if leaders are managers and just manage the people or the task

The point of a manager is to set direction, control the performance, etc. The point of the individual contributor is to implement the tasks and communicate status of to higher levels. Situations where this is not the case is in small groups, highly skilled environments, or under staffed work groups.

Having the separation is important as controlling communication and setting long term direction is a full time job. If the leader is unable to delegate the implementation details to their staff they will have poor span of control. Further the group will suffer as there is less focus on long term vision.

## Leaders and Visions

> People buy in to the leader first, then the vision. If they do not like the leader but like the vision, they get a new leader. If they do not like the leader or the vision, they get a new leader. If they do not like the vision but like the leader, they get a new vision. What strategies do you follow for your group to like you and buy into your vision?

### Its all about data

This week I interviewed a principal engineering manager, and asked this question. Here is some paraphrasing from my notes.

First he said the most important step is have the data to justify your vision. If you can imperially prove that it is the right call then people will be inclined to follow the vision. When it is not possible to have data to back up a road map then it needs to have make sense from a technical perspective.

Good methods for backing a technical perspective are demonstrating how it reduces complexity and simplifies the experience. As we enter into these unchartered waters, we need to come up with experiments and do A/B testing. Through these experiments we can find validations that our vision is the right way or course correct as needed.

Our goal should not be "to be liked," instead we should focus on being passionate but objective on our results. We need to lead by example, if we say one thing and do another it will reflect poorly on ourselves. If we follow this general thinking people will at least respect us professionally and that is more important than liking us personally (though they tend to be hand and hand).

### No, its about bottoms up leadership

After interviewing the first leader of my organization, I hunted down a senior director who leads a multi-billion dollar project. He had the opposite view, which I'll paraphrase from my notes.

He said that leaders don't create visions, they build teams of highly talented professionals and then define needs of the business. Once those professionals understand the challenges and why they need to be solved, they will come up with the ideas. Then the leader needs to promote collaboration so that the team not only feels that its their idea but that its worth investing real time into.

By using this "bottom up" approach there isn't a need for salesmanship. When people believe they are building on their own ideas, they work harder and think about the problems even outside of work. Given the larger amount of effort it is more likely to be successful.

There are times when the vision will still be unsuccessful, for example a competitor has better solution or is first to market. However this doesn't matter in the bigger picture as long as you emotionally engage the team. The losses will be less and the victories sweeter.

The senior director also recommended that people taking an organizational leadership course read the book "Managing Humans"

The book describes challenges in the process of transitioning from an individual contributor to being a steward of human assets. It tells of common pitfalls as we approach things from the an IC way of thinking when a people operate very differently.

## Project Oxygen: Building Better Bosses

Google collected a lot of metrics about its leadership and tried to define what makes a good boss. They concluded that the best bosses are those with interpersonal skills that left the people alone. Meanwhile technical competencies was at the bottom of the list of desired traits. 

From my experience that really depends on the maturity of the employee versus the complexity of the task. When we are entry level employees, and lack the confidence that we are even doing the right thing, have a more technical director is preferred. This enables the employee to get both the "how and why" which is typically lacking in theoretical studies (such as traditional colleges). 

As the employee gains the skills then they quickly move toward a point of wanting less oversight. Give me the requirements and due date, then leave me alone.

Strangely as we gain even more skills we move away from the "leave me alone" model and move back toward the highly collaborative mode. In this context having regular sync ups and technical discussions would be ideal for most projects.
