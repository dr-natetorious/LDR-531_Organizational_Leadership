## Strategies for motivation

If Alice can produce 115% the number of units of sprockets that Bob can; Alice needs to be rewarded relative to this higher transactional count. This encourages her to move faster, produced more units and has therefore created more revenue opportunity for the employer. In this scenario the rewards, are aligning to the business goals and strategy.

In comparison, if Alice writes 115% more software code than Bob what does that actually mean? Rewarding her ability to "type faster" does not directly translate into more revenue opportunity for the employer. This and various equivalent metrics do not make sense to provide monetary rewards, their is no strategic value to the employer.

For these mental tasks an better solution would be to make Alice feel appreciated and valued within the organization. People that are being paid for creativity often have a higher concern that the quality of their work is acknowledged. This makes sense as they have invested time and thought into the project, they want to know it was meaningful.

## What factors most influence your teams attitude and job satisfaction

The biggest factors over a team's attitude are trust and respect. If they do have these or it is not mutual the rest will be irrelevant. For example, if the employee does not trust that their manager will reward them for working hard they will not work hard. It's as simple as that.

Once trust has been established the next level requires looking at job satisfaction. The book made an interesting point that the opposite of satisfaction is no satisfaction, not dissatisfaction. What this means is that creating a great work environment requires more than paying people a fair wage and not micromanaging them.

According to the TED talk for this week; it means giving them autonomy, mastery, and purpose. These three characteristics are what typically make people enjoy their jobs.

Though according to Lopp, author of Managing Humans; he argues that no two employees are alike. In order to create job satisfaction requires communication and identifying how you can enable the employee to be successful under their definition.

## Should check their problems at the door

It depends on what problems are being referred to. If the employee is stressed out because they are unable to pay their rent or feed their children, the answer is no. The same is true for any other lower level item in the hierarchy of needs.

When an employer takes on an employee as a full time member of the team, they are effectively saying dedicate all of your time and thought to me. In exchange I will take care of you and provide a reasonable life style, relative to the type of work.

For higher level needs, such as the employee needs help with a divorce or drug addiction, the employer needs to provide avenues for the employee to get the help needed. This could be as cost efficient as listening or low overhead as providing them with time off.

Though it is not the employers responsibility to be a door mat, and let the employee walk over them. If the employee is routinely causing issues and is unable to act professionally, that needs to be addressed by leadership with training or performance warning.

## Why might the boss also need praise

In most corporate cultures the boss is "supposed to" show less emotions and convey they are in control of steering the ship. This can often result in slightly dehumanizing the boss and forgetting that they are another employee with a boss of their own. In a lot of ways your in the same spot.

As another employee they want to know that their tough choices and hard work is noticed and respected by their team. This does not mean giving credit where credit is not deserved, but it does mean letting them know they are appreciated. After all for every good boss there are at least a dozen mediocre ones.

Once praise is going one up and the boss is humanized, they will in turn feel the need to be nicer to you. They know that the respect is mutual and this leads to trust. With trust both parties become incentivized to work harder for the others needs.

## What is the purpose of verbal recognition

Verbal recognition is an extremely cost efficient method of reinforcement learning. It lets the employee know that they did a good job and that they are appreciated. In return they will feel good about the work and try to repeat it in the difference.

In order for it be to powerful, the recognition needs to be timely and specific. Compare "Thanks for working the weekend and getting that report out. The execs were very pleased" versus six months later, "Remember when that report you worked on all weekend six months ago, good job the execs were very pleased."

The feedback loop is too long in the second case. The employee will think I spent my personal time working on the report, but you couldn't find time for 6 months to thank me? Gee, thanks they probably only remembered because they need a sucker for a similar task soon.

Let's say this employee takes the complement and doesn't look more than surface deep. Even at that point that's 6 months worth of behavior that was not receiving the reinforced learning. That's 6 months of lower productivity, lower return, and lower value for the business.

## How does fear influence innovation and productivity within organizations

That point aligns with last weeks discussions on communication and negotiation. If we are angry and unpleasant then members of the team will be less inclined to work with us.

This will introduce other issues, such as poor communication and filtered responses. This makes sense as no one likes to be made fearful, and will go out of their way to not cause the boss to go crazy.

Another observation that ties this to previous discussions, is that leaders need to be `authorities not authority figures`. This means we need to be smart about our actions, and not abuse our power. Pointlessly adding road blocks, inducing fear tactics, are related negative behavior results in negative results.

Different emotions are different tools which can be used to get the needed results for the team. Though like any other construction project, the leader needs to know when a hammer versus a screw driver or saw is appropriate.

For example, if the business needs to make a critical dead line or they will lose the investment funds; this might be a good point to use fear as a motivator. That dead line is literally the potential death point of the business and their jobs, push them to harness that stress and deliver the results.

In contrast, when the ship is smooth sailing and there is no immediate risk; fear can be a strong demoralizer. During this phase of the business people want to feel safe, not worry about the mortgage, etc. Many of them are likely working on this smooth ship specifically for the safety.

### Always Be Closing

Here is a famous scene by Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross, where he uses fear and urgency to motivate the staff.

He calls them morons and losers, and tells them that they have no talent. After this clip (rest available on Netflix) the staff stays late and goes back over all their sells leads. Their needs (continue current lifestyle) require aligning with the needs of the business.

If they fail to meet the business needs, then the business has no need for them. https://youtu.be/Q4PE2hSqVnk

## Economics of not properly rewaring staff

I work at a fortune 100 high tech firm, and one of the biggest concerns is employee turn over. Our HR department says that between pay, benefits, and resources to actually perform the work; employees start at 200k per year.

That means that an employee has been there for 5 years, they have over a million dollars invested in training and utilizing that single employee. In terms of raw hours that's 12,000 hours of modeling and directing.

If they do not feel that they are properly rewarded, then they will leave and all of that investment has been nullified. To make matters worse the competitor will purchase that talent at a significant discount.

Assuming all things equal, and the competitor only retains this employee for 1 year. They are out 200k but were able to fully use that million dollars worth of education for the first employer.
